# Sinusoidal-Audio-Peripheral
This peripheral device takes in numerical inputs corresponding to musical notes from code provided by the user and creates sinusoidal waveforms which can be converted to sound, thus allowing the user to create music with smooth transitions between notes. The peripheral is written in "SCOMP" VHDL and developed to work with SCOMP microarchitecture which has been tested using a (DE-10 Standard) FPGA.
